# Mail 
## Description
The Mail project is a full-stack web application developed using Django and JavaScript. It provides users with a platform to send, receive, and manage emails. The application supports features such as composing new emails, displaying inbox and sent messages, archiving emails, marking emails as read, and replying to received messages. It utilizes Django's authentication system to handle user registration and login. The project follows a client-server architecture, where the frontend interacts with the backend API endpoints to perform various operations on the email data stored in the database. 

## Specifications
The project contains the following files:

1. index.html: The main HTML file for the web application.
2. inbox.js: The JavaScript file that handles the dynamic behavior of the web application.
3. admin.py: The Django admin file for registering models in the admin interface.
4. views.py: The Django views file that contains the backend logic for handling requests.
5. models.py: The Django models file that defines the database schema.
6. urls.py: The Django URLs file that maps URLs to views.

The project primarily focuses on the backend functionalities implemented using Django, JavaScript, and APIs, with less emphasis on the frontend. The main objective of the project was to build a robust email management system, with features such as composing emails, managing mailboxes (inbox, sent, archive), marking emails as read, and replying to messages.
